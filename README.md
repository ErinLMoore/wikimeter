## This is a project that can match the stress and/or rhyme of a given phrase against a large corpus of phrases.

Ok this process has two steps. One, you need to generate pickle files from whatever source you want to be able to compare phrases to. Included is a sample file of the common names of birds in csv format. You can use any csv or line-delimited text file. If you want to be able to use wikipedia article titles, go to https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20180320/ and download the one labled 'List of page titles in main namespace'. To create the pickle, run src/createPickle.py after replacing the filenames in the script (if necessary). Sorry these don't take command line args. These commands can take a few minutes if your source file is large.

Step two is comparing your desired phrase against these pickles. Sample code for this is in src/generate_lists.py. The birds list won't find many things that match both stress and rhyme, but I recommend testing the whole process out on the smaller birds file first.
